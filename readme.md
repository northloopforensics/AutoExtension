AutoExtension will iterate through a provided folder and add missing file extensions by checking extension-less files for their mime types.

The tool will copy the entire contents of the input folder and identify the files inside that lack a file extension.

It will then check the file type of the extension-less file and rename the copied file using the correct extension.
